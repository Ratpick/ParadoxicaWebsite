POSTSCRIPT
Hi Phil,

This a a first draft of assembling the hierarchical structure of the Principia Paradoxica website project + I thought it'd be fun to ask Claude to attempt to create an experimental landing page based on a screenplay adaptation of one of the creation myths in the trilogy. While the code structure is in place and hopefully hangs together:

Media Integration:

No media files (images, audio, backgrounds, etc.) have been added yet.
Feel free to comment out any code referencing these assets if it causes errorsâ€”or, better yet, suggest or create placeholders that reflect the project's essence. In the meantime, I'm working on some images also.
Creative Input:

Got any ideas for symbolic glyphs, particle animations, or thematic backgrounds? I'm all ears!
The project is really a canvas for blending technology and art for a grant totalling 75k to create an immersive arts project, no one else need see it and it would even be valid to have 'Under Construction' right at the front to show it's a foundation for what the grant could make possible. Visuals that evoke mystery, paradoxes, oraboration Opportunity:**
 I'd love your input, especially on the landing page a work of art, animations, soundscapes etc.
 Let me know any concepts and ideas you come up with you, and thanks for helping out.
